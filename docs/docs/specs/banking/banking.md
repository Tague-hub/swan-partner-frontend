# Web banking

Use Swan's web banking source code to **create your own banking app** for your users.

You can completely customize the **navigation** as well as your **branding**.

Several **pages** are included by default: *History*, *Account*, *Transfer*, *Cards*, *Members*, and *Profile*.
You can keep them all, remove some, or add your ownâ€”whatever you need.

Finally, included are some **workarounds**.
Let Swan know if you need other workarounds, or if you've found one that works well for your use case.
